# Multi-task-scheduling-system-for-multi-processor-server-with-effecient-load-balancing-alogorithm

Homogeneous single processors provide a new trend for various computing capabilities. As the processor speed and performance decreases, the main challenges found today are processor power consumption and low time taken at one task running. They can sufficiently reduce processor power consumption and can considerably decrease the speed of execution and performance. The single processors decrease the frequency of the processors and thus decrease the temperature of the system. Here introduced Heterogeneous Multi-Processor server (HMP) is better to schedule jobs as compared to homogenous multi processor server. Scheduling is essential for proper functioning of multi-core processors for parallel processing.
